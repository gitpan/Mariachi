=head1 HISTORY

What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.50    Friday 29th August, 2003

	Split some code out into Text::Original

	Added a --class option to allow dynamic selection of the main class
        from the command line.

        Split some of the default templates up.



=item 0.41	Friday 27th June, 2003

	Last release had a screwed up SIGNATURE file.  Since they keep biting
	me we'll stop shipping them for a while.


=item 0.4	Thursday 26th June, 2003

	Now we ship with a lurker-style output.

	template paths are specifyable

	template directories will be scanned for non-template files,
	and those that exist will be copied into the output tree

	Mariachi::Message now has first_line, first_sentence and
	others, to allow extra context in the thread index pages.

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES: 
	
	Command line interface changed.  Now instead of positional
	parameters we use named ones.

	Mariach->{list_name,input,output,threads_per_page} have all been
	replaced with a single AppConfig instance, C<config>
